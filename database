DB && ADB

ä¸€. DB
   (1) Database System Architecture - data abstraction; data independence.
   (2) Relational Databases - Relational data model; SQL.
   (3) Database design - Entity-relationship model, functional dependencies; normal forms; dependency preservation; information loss.
   (4) Introduction to OLAP - Multidimensional data model, data aggregation.
   (5) Storage Strategies - Indices and B-trees.
   (6) Transaction Management - ACID properties, concurrency control and recovery.

1. Relational Database -> a set of relations (relation -> a set of rows or tuples)
   (1) instance: a table with rows and columns
   (2) schema: name and type of each column.

2. SQL -> DDL -> Create/ Drop/ alter...
          DML (Data manipulation language) -> select from where...

3. Integrity Constraints(ICs)
   IC: condition that must be true for any instance of the database. eg: domain constraints
       ICs are specified when schema is defined.
       ICs are checked when relations are modified.
   A legal instance of a relation is one that satisfies all specified ICs.

   (1) Primary key constraints
   (2) Candidate key -> "UNIQUE"   candidate key choose one to be primary key.
   (3) Foreign key
   (4) Referential Integrity:
       -> delete/ update
         a. Default is NO ACTION(delete/ update is rejected)
         b. CASCADE(also delete all tuples that refer to deleted tuple)
         c. SET NULL/ SET DEFAULT(set foreign key value of referencing tuple)
