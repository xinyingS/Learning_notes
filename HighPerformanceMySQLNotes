1. Transaction
ACID: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

(1) Atomicity: A transaction must function as a single indivisible unit of work so that the entire transaction is either applied or rolled back.
          When transactions are atomic, there is no such thing as a partially completed transaction: it’s all or nothing.

(2) Consistency: The database should always move from one consistent state to the next.

(3) Isolation: The results of a transaction are usually indivisible to other transactions until the transaction is complete.

(4) Durability: Once committed, a transaction’s changes are permanent.This means the changes must be recorded such that data won’t be lost in a system crash.
