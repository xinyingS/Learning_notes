一、Course Architechture
    1. Basic multithreading
       (1) Process vs thread
       (2) Threads, runnables
       (3) Volatile, join(), notify()
       (4) Low and high level concurrency
    2. Complex problems
       (1) Library project
       (2) Dining philosophers problem
       (3) Simulation: mine sweeper
       (4) Conway's game of life
    3. Parellel Algorithm

二、
   1.
     Sequential

     multithreading  ->
     concurrency    -> at same time

   2.
     Thread join() -> waits for thread died (to finish it's task)

   3. Volatile -> slower -> threads to visit same area(RAM: Main memory)
      Cache  -> faster -> only one thread (located in it) can visit
